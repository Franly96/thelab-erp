# ERP Software

This is a basic Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software designed to manage core business processes.

## Getting Started

To get the ERP software up and running, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Node.js and npm (or Yarn or pnpm) installed on your system.

### Installation and Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd erp-software
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    This command will install all necessary project dependencies as defined in `package.json`.

    ```bash
    npm install
    # or if you use Yarn
    # yarn install
    # or if you use pnpm
    # pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Run the Application:**
    Once dependencies are installed, start the application. Refer to the `scripts` section in `package.json` for available commands. Typically, you can start the development server with:

    ```bash
    npm start
    # or if you use Yarn
    # yarn start
    # or if you use pnpm
    # pnpm start
    ```

4.  **Access the application:**
    The application should now be running, usually accessible in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in your application's configuration or `package.json` scripts).
